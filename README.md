make sure you have MySQL installed and are able to run a server locally as this is how we will be able to test and run our code.

Im using pycharm professional to work on this project because it has useful integrated DB tools that will help with the development process in this project

Clone this repository and you will have access to the modules ive outlined so far. 

## TODO
